### K-means Clustering

It is of interest to public health experts to see which countries are having similar trends in the COVID-19 outbreak in order to help further understand how the disease is spread. We use the K-mean clustering algorithm to cluster the countries into groups based on the three parameters (a, b and c) estimated above. This algorithm required one to pre-specify the number of clusters one wishes to group the observations into. It then aims to minimize the within cluster correlation.
 
To begin this minimization process, K observations are randomly chosen and their observed predictors values are used to initiate the centroid for each cluster. The K centroids will be p dimensional, where p is the dimension of the variables given to the algorithm to create the clusters. In our case p = 3 ($\hat{a}$, $\hat{b}$, and $\hat{c}$). Each observation is then assigned to the cluster for which it has the smallest distance to the centroid. We chose to use Euclidian distance, such that the distance to the centroid of each cluster per observation is measured as $\sum_{j=1}^p(x_{ij}-\bar{x}_{j})^2$ for observation i (i = 1,...,n). The centroid for the $k^{th}$ cluster is then recomputed as the p averages of the observations in each cluster. These steps are repeated until the clusters stop changing. 

We have estimated logistic growth curves for 109 countries. We explored different clustering values and found that for k = 2, 98 observations were placed in cluster 1 and 11 observations were placed in cluster 2. For k = 3, the observations were divided into 1, 12, and 96 observations per cluster. For k = 3, the observations were divided into 1, 9, 10, and 98 observations per cluster.
