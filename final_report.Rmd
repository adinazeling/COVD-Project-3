## Introduction

COVID-19 is currently the world's largest public health crisis. One of the many challenges presented by the pandemic has been the ability to understand and predict the trajectory of disease. Being able to estimate values such as expected total cases and fatalities, greatly affects a nation's decision's to combat the disease and prepare their healthcare systems. Furthermore, the effect of the virus is varied in different countries and regions, thus requiring different predictions to assist in making more local decisions.

The logistic growth curve has been traditionally applied to model epidemics and disease data. In the early days of disease, the growth is exponential but then slows as the population is exposed and begins to develop immunity. This curve is characterized by three parameters:  the upper bounder (maximum number of cases), growth rate, and the mid-point (when the spread of disease begins to slow). We propose using the Newton Raphson algorithm on a logistic growth curve model to predict these parameters for different regions in the US and countries.
